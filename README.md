Redux Introduction Project

React project from the [Ultimate React Course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Implementing:

- classic redux:
  - redux: create reducers and combine them for a store,`createStore` (deprecated), `combineReducers`
  - react-redux: `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, `connect` and the mapStateToProps function to pass state as props
- Modern Redux:
  - `redux thunk` middleware for asynchronous code
